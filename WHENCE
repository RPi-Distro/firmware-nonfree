Version: 4.0.4.3.7

File: ti-connectivity/wl1251-nvs.bin

Licence: Redistributable. See LICENCE.wl1251 for details.

The published NVS files are for testing only.  Every device needs to
have a unique NVS which is properly calibrated for best results.

The driver expects to find the firmwares under a ti-connectivity subdirectory.
So if your system looks for firmwares in /lib/firmware, the firmwares for
wl12xx chips must be located in /lib/firmware/ti-connectivity/.

The NVS file includes two parts:
	 - radio calibration
	 - HW configuration parameters (aka. INI values)

The published NVS files are for testing only.  Every device needs to
hava a unique NVS which is properly calibrated for best results.  You
can find more information about NVS generation for your device here:

http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/wl12xx/calibrator

If you're using a wl127x based device, use a symbolic link called
wl1271-nvs.bin that links to the wl127x-nvs.bin file.  If you are
using wl128x, link to wl128x-nvs.bin instead.

The driver expects to find the firmwares under a ti-connectivity
subdirectory.  So if your system looks for firmwares in /lib/firmware,
the firmwares for wl12xx chips must be located in
/lib/firmware/ti-connectivity/.

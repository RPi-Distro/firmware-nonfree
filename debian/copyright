 .
 7.      MISCELLANEOUS
 .

 SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES AND OTHER APPLICABLE EXPORT-RELATED LAWS AND
 REGULATIONS AND THAT YOU MAY NOT EXPORT, RE-EXPORT OR TRANSFER THE SOFTWARE OR
 ANY DIRECT PRODUCT OF THE SOFTWARE EXCEPT AS PERMITTED UNDER THOSE LAWS.
 WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, EXPORT, RE-EXPORT OR TRANSFER OF THE SOFTWARE
 TO CUBA, IRAN, NORTH KOREA, SUDAN AND SYRIA IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 7.2     Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
 benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns, provided,
 however that Licensee may not assign this Agreement or any rights or obligation
 hereunder, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, without
 the prior written consent of Broadcom, and any such attempted assignment shall
 be void.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee may assign this Agreement to
 a successor to all or substantially all of its business or assets to which this
 Agreement relates that is not a competitor of Broadcom.
 .
 7.3.    Governing Law; Venue.  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of
 California without regard to any conflict-of-laws rules, and the United Nations
 Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is hereby excluded.
 The sole jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter
 hereof shall be the state and federal courts located in the County of Orange,
 California, and both parties hereby consent to such jurisdiction and venue.
 .
 7.4.    Severability.  All terms and provisions of this Agreement shall, if
 possible, be construed in a manner which makes them valid, but in the event any
 term or provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent
 jurisdiction to be illegal or unenforceable, the validity or enforceability of
 the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected if the illegal or
 unenforceable provision does not materially affect the intent of this
 Agreement.  If the illegal or unenforceable provision materially affects the
 intent of the parties to this Agreement, this Agreement shall become
 terminated.
 .
 7.5.    Equitable Relief.  Licensee hereby acknowledges that its breach of this
 Agreement would cause irreparable harm and significant injury to Broadcom that
 may be difficult to ascertain and that a remedy at law would be inadequate.
 Accordingly, Licensee agrees that Broadcom shall have the right to seek and
 obtain immediate injunctive relief to enforce obligations under the Agreement
 in addition to any other rights and remedies it may have.
 .
 7.6.    Waiver.  The waiver of, or failure to enforce, any breach or default
 hereunder shall not constitute the waiver of any other or subsequent breach or
 default.
 .
 7.7.    Entire Agreement.  This Agreement sets forth the entire Agreement
 between the parties and supersedes any and all prior proposals, agreements and
 representations between them, whether written or oral concerning the Software.
 This Agreement may be changed only by mutual agreement of the parties in
 writing.

 IMPORTANT NOTICE -- READ CAREFULLY: This License For Customer Use of
 NVIDIA Software ("LICENSE") is the agreement which governs use of
 the software of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries ("NVIDIA")
 downloadable herefrom, including computer software and associated
 printed materials ("SOFTWARE").  By downloading, installing, copying,
 or otherwise using the SOFTWARE, you agree to be bound by the terms
 of this LICENSE.  If you do not agree to the terms of this LICENSE,
 do not download the SOFTWARE.
 .
 RECITALS
 .
 Use of NVIDIA's products requires three elements: the SOFTWARE, the
 hardware, and a personal computer. The SOFTWARE is protected by copyright
 laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual
 property laws and treaties.  The SOFTWARE may be protected by various
 patents, and is not sold, and instead is only licensed for use, strictly
 in accordance with this document.  The hardware is protected by various
 patents, and is sold, but this agreement does not cover that sale, since
 it may not necessarily be sold as a package with the SOFTWARE.  This
 agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of the SOFTWARE LICENSE only.
 .
 1.  DEFINITIONS
 .
 1.1  Customer.  Customer means the entity or individual that
 downloads or otherwise obtains the SOFTWARE.
 .
 2.  GRANT OF LICENSE
 .
 2.1  Rights and Limitations of Grant.  NVIDIA hereby grants Customer
 the following non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the
 SOFTWARE, with the following limitations:
 .
 2.1.1  Rights.  Customer may install and use multiple copies of the
 SOFTWARE on a shared computer or concurrently on different computers,
 and make multiple back-up copies of the SOFTWARE, solely for Customer's
 use within Customer's Enterprise. "Enterprise" shall mean individual use
 by Customer or any legal entity (such as a corporation or university)
 and the subsidiaries it owns by more than fifty percent (50%).
 .
 2.1.2  Open Source Exception.  Notwithstanding the foregoing terms
 of Section 2.1.1, SOFTWARE may be copied and redistributed solely for
 use on operating systems distributed under the terms of an OSI-approved
 open source license as listed by the Open Source Initiative at
 http://opensource.org, provided that the binary files thereof are not
 modified, and Customer provides a copy of this license with the SOFTWARE.
 .
 2.1.3  Limitations.
 .
 No Reverse Engineering.  Customer may not reverse engineer,
 decompile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE, nor attempt in any other
 manner to obtain the source code.
 .
 Usage. SOFTWARE is licensed only for use with microprocessor(s) which have
 been (i) designed by NVIDIA and (ii) either (a) sold by or (b) licensed by
 NVIDIA. Customer shall not use SOFTWARE in conjunction with, nor cause
 SOFTWARE to be executed by, any other microprocessor.
 .
 No Translation. Customer shall not translate SOFTWARE, nor cause or permit
 SOFTWARE to be translated, from the architecture or language in which it is
 originally provided by NVIDIA, into any other architecture or language.
 .
 No Rental.  Customer may not rent or lease the SOFTWARE to someone
 else.
 .
 3.  TERMINATION
 .
 This LICENSE will automatically terminate if Customer fails to
 comply with any of the terms and conditions hereof.  In such event,
 Customer must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE and all of its
 component parts.
 .
 Defensive Suspension.  If Customer commences or participates in any legal
 proceeding against NVIDIA, then NVIDIA may, in its sole discretion,
 suspend or terminate all license grants and any other rights provided
 under this LICENSE during the pendency of such legal proceedings.
 .
 4.  COPYRIGHT
 .
 All title and copyrights in and to the SOFTWARE (including but
 not limited to all images, photographs, animations, video, audio,
 music, text, and other information incorporated into the SOFTWARE),
 the accompanying printed materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE,
 are owned by NVIDIA, or its suppliers.  The SOFTWARE is protected
 by copyright laws and international treaty provisions.  Accordingly,
 Customer is required to treat the SOFTWARE like any other copyrighted
 material, except as otherwise allowed pursuant to this LICENSE
 and that it may make one copy of the SOFTWARE solely for backup or
 archive purposes.
 .
 5.  APPLICABLE LAW
 .
 This agreement shall be deemed to have been made in, and shall be
 construed pursuant to, the laws of the State of California.
 .
 6.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION ON LIABILITY
 .
 6.1  No Warranties.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND NVIDIA AND ITS SUPPLIERS
 DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
 NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
 FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
 .
 6.2  No Liability for Consequential Damages.  TO THE MAXIMUM
 EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL NVIDIA OR
 ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR
 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
 DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS
 OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT
 OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF NVIDIA HAS
 BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7.  MISCELLANEOUS

 The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
 Sale of Goods is specifically disclaimed.  If any provision of this
 LICENSE is inconsistent with, or cannot be fully enforced under,
 the law, such provision will be construed as limited to the extent
 necessary to be consistent with and fully enforceable under the law.
 This agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement between
 the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes
 all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements relating
 to such subject matter, whether oral or written.  Customer agrees
 that it will not ship, transfer or export the SOFTWARE into any
 country, or use the SOFTWARE in any manner, prohibited by the
 United States Bureau of Export Administration or any export laws,
 restrictions or regulations.  This LICENSE may only be modified in
 writing signed by an authorized officer of NVIDIA.

 nor any act by QTI or any of its affiliates pursuant to this Agreement or
 relating to the Materials (including, without limitation, the provision by QTI
 or its affiliates of the Materials), shall provide to You any license or any
 other rights whatsoever under any patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights
 or any other intellectual property of QTI or any of its affiliates, except for
 the copyright rights expressly licensed under this Agreement. You understand and
 agree that:

 notice to You. Upon termination You must, to the extent possible, delete or
 destroy all copies of the Materials in Your possession and the license granted
 to You in this Agreement shall terminate. Sections 1.2 through 10 shall survive
 the termination of this Agreement. In the event that any restrictions,
 conditions, limitations are found to be either invalid or unenforceable, the
 rights granted to You in Section 1 (License) shall be null, void and ineffective
 from the Effective Date, and QTI shall also have the right to terminate this
 Agreement immediately, and with retroactive effect to the effective date.
 .
 5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  IN NO EVENT SHALL QTI, QTI's AFFILIATES OR ITS
 LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES,
 INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, OR OTHER INCIDENTAL
 DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE, OR THE DELIVERY OR FAILURE
 TO DELIVER, ANY OF THE DELIVERABLES, OR ANY BREACH OF ANY OBLIGATION UNDER THIS
 AGREEMENT, EVEN IF QTI HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT
 REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOUR REMEDIES HEREUNDER ARE DETERMINED TO HAVE FAILED OF
 THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF QTI, QTI's AFFILIATES AND ITS
 LICENSORS, AND THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF YOU, FOR ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF
 ACTION ARISING HEREUNDER (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL NOT

  *
  *  First, the polynomial itself and its table of feedback terms.  The
  *  polynomial is
  *  X^32+X^26+X^23+X^22+X^16+X^12+X^11+X^10+X^8+X^7+X^5+X^4+X^2+X^1+X^0
  *
  *  Note that we take it "backwards" and put the highest-order term in
  *  the lowest-order bit.  The X^32 term is "implied"; the LSB is the
  *  X^31 term, etc.  The X^0 term (usually shown as "+1") results in
  *  the MSB being 1
  *
  *  Note that the usual hardware shift register implementation, which
  *  is what we're using (we're merely optimizing it by doing eight-bit
  *  chunks at a time) shifts bits into the lowest-order term.  In our
  *  implementation, that means shifting towards the right.  Why do we
  *  do it this way?  Because the calculated CRC must be transmitted in
  *  order from highest-order term to lowest-order term.  UARTs transmit
  *  characters in order from LSB to MSB.  By storing the CRC this way
  *  we hand it to the UART in the order low-byte to high-byte; the UART
  *  sends each low-bit to hight-bit; and the result is transmission bit
  *  by bit from highest- to lowest-order term without requiring any bit
  *  shuffling on our part.  Reception works similarly
  *
  *  The feedback terms table consists of 256, 32-bit entries.  Notes
  *
  *      The table can be generated at runtime if desired; code to do so
  *      is shown later.  It might not be obvious, but the feedback
  *      terms simply represent the results of eight shift/xor opera
  *      tions for all combinations of data and CRC register values
  *
  *      The values must be right-shifted by eight bits by the "updcrc
  *      logic; the shift must be unsigned (bring in zeroes).  On some
  *      hardware you could probably optimize the shift in assembler by
  *      using byte-swap instructions
  *      polynomial $edb88320

 .
 7.      MISCELLANEOUS
 .

 SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES AND OTHER APPLICABLE EXPORT-RELATED LAWS AND
 REGULATIONS AND THAT YOU MAY NOT EXPORT, RE-EXPORT OR TRANSFER THE SOFTWARE OR
 ANY DIRECT PRODUCT OF THE SOFTWARE EXCEPT AS PERMITTED UNDER THOSE LAWS.
 WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, EXPORT, RE-EXPORT OR TRANSFER OF THE SOFTWARE
 TO CUBA, IRAN, NORTH KOREA, SUDAN AND SYRIA IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 7.2     Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
 benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns, provided,
 however that Licensee may not assign this Agreement or any rights or obligation
 hereunder, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, without
 the prior written consent of Broadcom, and any such attempted assignment shall
 be void.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee may assign this Agreement to
 a successor to all or substantially all of its business or assets to which this
 Agreement relates that is not a competitor of Broadcom.
 .
 7.3.    Governing Law; Venue.  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of
 California without regard to any conflict-of-laws rules, and the United Nations
 Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is hereby excluded.
 The sole jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter
 hereof shall be the state and federal courts located in the County of Orange,
 California, and both parties hereby consent to such jurisdiction and venue.
 .
 7.4.    Severability.  All terms and provisions of this Agreement shall, if
 possible, be construed in a manner which makes them valid, but in the event any
 term or provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent
 jurisdiction to be illegal or unenforceable, the validity or enforceability of
 the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected if the illegal or
 unenforceable provision does not materially affect the intent of this
 Agreement.  If the illegal or unenforceable provision materially affects the
 intent of the parties to this Agreement, this Agreement shall become
 terminated.
 .
 7.5.    Equitable Relief.  Licensee hereby acknowledges that its breach of this
 Agreement would cause irreparable harm and significant injury to Broadcom that
 may be difficult to ascertain and that a remedy at law would be inadequate.
 Accordingly, Licensee agrees that Broadcom shall have the right to seek and
 obtain immediate injunctive relief to enforce obligations under the Agreement
 in addition to any other rights and remedies it may have.
 .
 7.6.    Waiver.  The waiver of, or failure to enforce, any breach or default
 hereunder shall not constitute the waiver of any other or subsequent breach or
 default.
 .
 7.7.    Entire Agreement.  This Agreement sets forth the entire Agreement
 between the parties and supersedes any and all prior proposals, agreements and
 representations between them, whether written or oral concerning the Software.
 This Agreement may be changed only by mutual agreement of the parties in
 writing.

   patent infringement claim against QTI, its affiliates, or any of QTI's or
   QTI's affiliates' suppliers and/or direct or indirect customers.  QTI hereby
   reserves all rights not expressly granted herein.
 .
   1.4 Third Party Software and Materials.  The Software may contain or link to
   certain software and/or materials that are written or owned by third parties.

   different terms and conditions and are not licensed to you under the terms of
   this Agreement.  You agree to comply with all terms and conditions imposed on
   you in the applicable third party licenses.  Such terms and conditions may
   impose certain obligations on you as a condition to the permitted use of such
   third party code and materials.  QTI does not represent or warrant that such
   third party licensors have or will continue to license or make available their

   and all right, title and interest in and to any such inventions, product
   improvements, and modifications will vest solely in QTI.
 .

 IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE MATERIALS OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION OR DOCUMENTATION

 MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR AGAINST INFRINGEMENT, OR
 ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF TRADE USAGE OR OUT OF A COURSE OF
 DEALING OR COURSE OF PERFORMANCE.  NOTHING CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE
 CONSTRUED AS (I) A WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION BY QTI, ITS LICENSORS OR
 AFFILIATES AS TO THE VALIDITY OR SCOPE OF ANY PATENT, COPYRIGHT OR OTHER
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT OR (II) A WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION BY QTI THAT ANY

 RESPONSIBILITY OF YOU TO MAKE SUCH DETERMINATION AS IS NECESSARY WITH RESPECT TO
 THE ACQUISITION OF LICENSES UNDER PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF
 THIRD PARTIES.
 .
 3. NO OTHER LICENSES OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. Neither this Agreement,
 nor any act by QTI or any of its affiliates pursuant to this Agreement or
 relating to the Materials (including, without limitation, the provision by QTI
 or its affiliates of the Materials), shall provide to You any license or any
 other rights whatsoever under any patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights
 or any other intellectual property of QTI or any of its affiliates, except for
 the copyright rights expressly licensed under this Agreement. You understand and
 agree that:
 .
   (i) Neither this Agreement, nor delivery of the Materials, grants any right to
   practice, or any other right at all with respect to, any patent of QTI or any
   of its affiliates; and
 .
   (ii) A separate license agreement from QUALCOMM Incorporated is needed to use
   or practice any patent of QUALCOMM Incorporated. You agree not to contend in
   any context that, as a result of the provision or use of the Materials, either
   QTI or any of its affiliates has any obligation to extend, or You or any other
   party has obtained any right to, any license, whether express or implied, with
   respect to any patent of QTI or any of its affiliates for any purpose.
 .
 4. TERMINATION.  This Agreement shall be effective upon acceptance, or access or
 use of the Materials (whichever occurs first) by You and shall continue until
 terminated. You may terminate the Agreement at any time by deleting and
 destroying all copies of the Materials and all related information in Your
 possession or control. This Agreement terminates immediately and automatically,
 with or without notice, if You fail to comply with any provision hereof.
 Additionally, QTI may at any time terminate this Agreement, without cause, upon
 notice to You. Upon termination You must, to the extent possible, delete or
 destroy all copies of the Materials in Your possession and the license granted
 to You in this Agreement shall terminate. Sections 1.2 through 10 shall survive
 the termination of this Agreement. In the event that any restrictions,
 conditions, limitations are found to be either invalid or unenforceable, the
 rights granted to You in Section 1 (License) shall be null, void and ineffective
 from the Effective Date, and QTI shall also have the right to terminate this
 Agreement immediately, and with retroactive effect to the effective date.
 .
 5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  IN NO EVENT SHALL QTI, QTI's AFFILIATES OR ITS
 LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES,
 INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, OR OTHER INCIDENTAL
 DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE, OR THE DELIVERY OR FAILURE
 TO DELIVER, ANY OF THE DELIVERABLES, OR ANY BREACH OF ANY OBLIGATION UNDER THIS
 AGREEMENT, EVEN IF QTI HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT
 REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOUR REMEDIES HEREUNDER ARE DETERMINED TO HAVE FAILED OF
 THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF QTI, QTI's AFFILIATES AND ITS
 LICENSORS, AND THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF YOU, FOR ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF
 ACTION ARISING HEREUNDER (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL NOT
 EXCEED US$50.
 .
 6. INDEMNIFICATION.  You agree to indemnify and hold harmless QTI and its
 officers, directors, employees and successors and assigns against any and all
 third party claims, demands, causes of action, losses, liabilities, damages,
 costs and expenses, incurred by QTI (including but not limited to costs of
 defense, investigation and reasonable attorney's fees) arising out of, resulting
 from or related to: (i) any breach of this Agreement by You; and (ii) your acts,
 omissions, products and services.  If requested by QTI, You agree to defend QTI
 in connection with any third party claims, demands, or causes of action
 resulting from, arising out of or in connection with any of the foregoing.
 .
 7. ASSIGNMENT.  You shall not assign this Agreement or any right or interest
 under this Agreement, nor delegate any obligation to be performed under this
 Agreement, without QTI's prior written consent.  For purposes of this Section 7,
 an "assignment" by You under this Section shall be deemed to include, without
 limitation, any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of its
 assets, or any substantial change in the management or control of You.
 Any attempted assignment in contravention of this Section 9 shall be void.
 QTI may freely assign this Agreement or delegate any or all of its rights and
 obligations hereunder to any third party.
 .
 8. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS; APPLICABLE LAW.  You agree to comply with all

  *
  *  First, the polynomial itself and its table of feedback terms.  The
  *  polynomial is
  *  X^32+X^26+X^23+X^22+X^16+X^12+X^11+X^10+X^8+X^7+X^5+X^4+X^2+X^1+X^0
  *
  *  Note that we take it "backwards" and put the highest-order term in
  *  the lowest-order bit.  The X^32 term is "implied"; the LSB is the
  *  X^31 term, etc.  The X^0 term (usually shown as "+1") results in
  *  the MSB being 1
  *
  *  Note that the usual hardware shift register implementation, which
  *  is what we're using (we're merely optimizing it by doing eight-bit
  *  chunks at a time) shifts bits into the lowest-order term.  In our
  *  implementation, that means shifting towards the right.  Why do we
  *  do it this way?  Because the calculated CRC must be transmitted in
  *  order from highest-order term to lowest-order term.  UARTs transmit
  *  characters in order from LSB to MSB.  By storing the CRC this way
  *  we hand it to the UART in the order low-byte to high-byte; the UART
  *  sends each low-bit to hight-bit; and the result is transmission bit
  *  by bit from highest- to lowest-order term without requiring any bit
  *  shuffling on our part.  Reception works similarly
  *
  *  The feedback terms table consists of 256, 32-bit entries.  Notes
  *
  *      The table can be generated at runtime if desired; code to do so
  *      is shown later.  It might not be obvious, but the feedback
  *      terms simply represent the results of eight shift/xor opera
  *      tions for all combinations of data and CRC register values
  *
  *      The values must be right-shifted by eight bits by the "updcrc
  *      logic; the shift must be unsigned (bring in zeroes).  On some
  *      hardware you could probably optimize the shift in assembler by
  *      using byte-swap instructions
  *      polynomial $edb88320
